Ultimate Slider is an easy-to-use slider plugin that lets you add a clean, modern, responsive slider to any page on your WordPress site using a simple slider shortcode. It includes multiple different slide transition effects to make your slider unique. There are also various other slider customization options, including slider autoplay and the ability to set the slider delay and slide interval times. There is even a custom CSS input that lets you further modify the slider styling, so you can get it looking and working exactly as you need.

Simply insert the shortcode above into any page to display your slider. 

The Ultimate Slider plugin fully integrates with both the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-product-catalogue/">Ultimate Product Catalog</a> plugin and WooCommerce. This means that you can choose to have a slide's content and image pulled directly from a specific product from either the Ultimate Product Catalog or WooCommerce. Alternatively, you can choose to just type in the slide content and set either the featured image or the first image in your post as the slide image.

Each slide has a customizable title and text area. You can also add custom links to each slide in the form of buttons, offering your visitors an easy and upfront way of accessing the most important pages on your site.
